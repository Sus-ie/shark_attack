# Shark Attack Analysis

## Overview
The **Shark Attack Analysis** is a side project created during the **IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp**. Shark attacks, while rare, can have serious consequences for beachgoers and marine enthusiasts. Studying these incidents helps us understand the factors that contribute to shark attacks, enabling better safety measures, awareness, and even conservation efforts. The goal of this project is to clean and analyze a dataset on shark attacks using Python and data wrangling techniques. By preparing the data for analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful insights.

## Approach
1. **Initial Dataset Examination**: Investigate possible patterns such as shark attacks being more common in specific locations or during certain activities.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Using pandas to apply at least five data cleaning techniques, addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: After cleaning, follow basic EDA to validate any hypotheses and extract key insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: Used for collaborative coding.

## Key Insights
- Insights and hypotheses validated or disproved through EDA.
- Final analysis and conclusions on shark attack trends.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset and code.
- Visualizations and insights from EDA.
- Project presentation.

This is an ongoing project.
