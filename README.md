# Shark Attack Analysis

## Overview
Here you have the **Shark Attack Analysis** side project, created in the **IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp**. The goal of this project is to clean and analyze a dataset on shark attacks using Python and data wrangling techniques. By preparing the data for analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful insights for a chosen use case.

## Approach
1. **Initial Dataset Examination**: Investigate possible patterns such as shark attacks being more common in specific locations or during certain activities.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Using pandas to apply at least five data cleaning techniques, addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: After cleaning, follow basic EDA to validate any hypotheses and extract key insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: Used for collaborative coding.

## Key Insights
- Insights and hypotheses validated or disproved through EDA.
- Final analysis and conclusions on shark attack trends.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset and code.
- Visualizations and insights from EDA.
- Project presentation.

This is an ongoing project.
